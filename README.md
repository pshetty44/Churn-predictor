### 1 Motivation:
A ride-sharing company is interested in predicting rider retention. To help explore this question, the company has provided a sample dataset of a cohort of users who signed up for an account.
The goal of this project is to understand what factors are the best predictors for retention, and offer suggestions to operationalize those insights to help the company.
We need to not only build a model that minimizes error, but also a model that allows you to interpret the factors that contributed to your predictions.

### 2 Project Scope:
1. Find key features in the data set that can help reduce churn.
2. Build a model that can predict churn given new user information.
